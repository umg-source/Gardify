Either get microbes from semi-done compost or generate a fresh patch by adding cow dung. You can also add buttermilk to kickstart the microbial colony.\n\nStep 4: Provide Oxygen\n\nIn aerobic composting, providing oxygen is very crucial for a smell-free composting cycle and to avoid crawlies like maggots. Either you can make perforated holes in your container or churn the pile of waste once every four days.\n\nStep 5: Layering\n\nAerobic composting will prepare manure in 40-45 days.
